content: "Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) technology is a key component of computer-assisted pronunciation training system (CAPT). The mainstream method is based on deep neural network automatic speech recognition. Many works and applications focus on the pronunciation score and neglect the meaningful feedback. We are going to deploy a system based on multi-model self-supervised learning for education toward fine-grained feedback, such as articulatory feedback. The CAPT system can be enhanced by providing articulatory feedback about the pronunciation error in addition to detecting and recognizing. We aim to develop deep learning based techniques to understand how human learn to speak a second language and in what way we can integrate automatic speech technology into this process. "
