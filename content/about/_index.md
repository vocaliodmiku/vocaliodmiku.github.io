Hi, this is Linkai Peng. I am an ML engineer @ NetEase YouDao. I am passionate about using cutting-edge ML technologies to boost the spoken Human-Computer Interaction system. A central focus of my current work is developing self-supervised neural networks to improve our ASR related [industry products][1], including ASR, CAPT. I also have an interest in analysis that lie in cross-language perception and production, e.g. the comprehension of L2 speech.
